# 🛡️ Incident Response Automation Toolkit

An **educational cybersecurity toolkit** that simulates real-world SOC monitoring, detection, and incident response using **offline, rule-based analysis**.

Built with **Python and Streamlit** to safely demonstrate cybersecurity workflows without touching live systems.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Incident Response Automation Toolkit** is a modular cybersecurity simulation platform designed for students and researchers.

It mimics how **Security Operations Centers (SOC)** detect, analyze, and respond to threats — all in a **safe, offline environment**.

The toolkit processes sample logs and files to generate **alerts, threat scores, and structured incident reports** via an interactive dashboard.

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 📧 Phishing Detector
- Detects suspicious emails using keywords, sender mismatches, and simulated blacklists

### 🌐 Network Analyzer
- Analyzes sample network logs to flag anomalies and suspicious traffic

### 📜 Log Analyzer
- Scans system logs for brute-force attempts, privilege escalation, and anomalies

### 🖥️ Host-Based IDS (HIDS)
- Monitors local folders for unauthorized file changes (simulated)

### 🔍 Vulnerability Scanner
- Simulates port scanning and vulnerability detection using predefined patterns

### 🎭 Simulator Module
- Auto-generates fake incidents for demos and testing
